This repo is very much a work in progress.  Poke around, but we don't recommend using this in production yet!

## Installation (untesetd!)
Until we have a stable release, we will stay out of packagelist, but you can install via composer like so:

    {
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/magicalcows/mooforms"
            }
        ],
        "require": {
            "magicalcows/mooforms": "master"
        }
    }

Or clone the repo, and switch to the `0.0.1-dev` branch:

    git clone https://github.com/magicalcows/mooforms.git
    cd mooforms
    checkout 0.0.1-dev

## Setup

If you're using composer, then just include the `autoload.php` file from your `vendor` folder.
If you download/clone the repo or something, you just need to include `lib/MooForms/Form.php` and setup any `use` statements you
want to use.
